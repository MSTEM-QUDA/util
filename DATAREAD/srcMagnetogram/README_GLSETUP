The EEGGL Python script can run on both Mac and PC computers with 
Python (3 and above), IDL and BATSRUS Idl package.
Make a link to SWMF/share/Python/pyfits here for remap script.

NOTE: the IDL EEGGL script - SWMF_GLSETUP.pro is outdated and no 
longer used.

To get help with available options:
GLSETUP.py -h 

To run the script with recommended options:
GLSETUP.py InputFitsFileName -CMESpeed InputSpeed 

Some Examples:

Remap the fits file grid to uniform grid:

GLSETUP.py InputFitsFileName -outgrid uniform -CMESpeed InputSpeed 

To use HMI vector magnetograms for helicity determination
download the HMI fits files and save in this srcMagnetogram folder:

GLSETUP.py InputFitsFileName -CMESpeed InputSpeed --DoHMI

The user can input the Longitude and Latitude (in degrees) of the positive and 
negative spot centers:

GLSETUP.py InputFitsFileName -CMESpeed InputSpeed -LonPosIn LonPos 
-LatPosIn LatPos -LonNegIn LatNeg -LatNegIn LatNeg

OR the choose via clicking:

1. Click (LEFT Button) the CME source region with the positive
polarity.

2. Click (RIGHT Button) the CME source region with the negative
polarity.

The recommended GL flux rope parameters will be calculated and shown.

*For Mac users, the IDL "CURSOR" routine may hang and does not return
 output. There is an easy fix for that problem. If you are using Mac
 OS X 10.7 or higher, 2 steps to get the CURSOR routine work:

1. Open the X11 preferences dialog, then select the "Windows" pane.
2. Enable "Click-through Inactive Windows."
