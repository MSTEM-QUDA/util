{\bf To account for excitation of atoms and ions} we need to distinguish atoms and ions
not only by their ionization states, $i$, but also by their excitation levels.
For simplicity multiple excitation and autoionization are neglected,
and we only account for exitation that raises the principal quantum number of the
outermost electron, which becomes equal to $n$, so that the excitation state
can be expressed by a single integer number $n$.

The population of ions of state $i$, $p_i$, is now split into smaller populations, $p_{i,n}$,
with a particular excitation level, $n$, defined.
That is why the statistical weights, $w_{i,n}$, and, hence, the statistical sum and the partition functions
become more complex:
\begin{equation}
w_{i,n} = 2 n^2 \cdot g_e^i \exp \left( -\frac{E^*_i + E^{exc}_{i,n}}{T} \right),\qquad
S = \sum_{i=0}^{i_{max}} \sum_{n=n_{gr}}^{\infty} w_{i,n},\qquad
p_{i,n} = \frac{w_{i,n}}{S},
\end{equation}
where $n_{gr}$ is the principal quantum number of the outermost electron
of the atom or the ion of interest (having ionization state $i$) in the ground state.
The excitation energy, $E^{exc}_{i,n}$, we calculate within a Bohr-like model, which is expressed in
Eq.(2.9) from \cite{ionmix}:
\begin{equation}
E^{exc}_{i,n} = I_i \cdot n_{gr}^2 \left( \frac1{n_{gr}^2} - \frac1{n^2} \right).
\end{equation}

Up to this point mean values and covariances were being calculated over $i_{max}+1$ possible
values of $i$. But now $i$ is not the only variable the energy levels depend on.
Accounting for excitation levels the way described above leads us to energy levels
being a function of $i$ and $n$.
This only increases the number of terms in the statistical sum, but does not change
anything in principle. To obtain the thermodynamic variables and the thermodynamic functions
we can just replace the mean values over $i$ with mean values over $i$ and $n$ in the
Eqs.(\ref{generalE}), (\ref{generalP}), (\ref{generalCv}),
(\ref{generalPT}), (\ref{generalCompr}) and substitute the new expression for energy levels.

The excitation energy, $E^{exc}_{i,n}$, does not contribute to $\partial E / \partial V$,
therefore substitution of the new energy levels, $E_{i,n}$, into
Eqs.(\ref{madE}), (\ref{madP}), (\ref{madCv}), (\ref{madPT}), (\ref{madCompr})
gives the correct formulas for the model of excitation levels.
