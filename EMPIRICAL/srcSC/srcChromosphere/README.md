Collisional Two-Fluid Chromosphere Solver
=========================================

This is based off [Al Shidi, et.al 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-019-1513-8)
and porting code from [comfi](https://github.com/qalshidi/comfi) model with
an attempt to make it cpu only.

[Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html) is required and might
be included at a later date. Copy the `include/` directory from the
`armadillo...tar.xz` file to this `srcChromosphere/` folder.
